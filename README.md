# WoWFormatParser

WoW format parsing and JSON exporter. 

Currently supports the following [formats](WoWFormatParser/WoWFormat.cs) for builds 0.5.3.3368 to 1.12.1.5875.  
Note: for DBC, TOC and WDB only "meta" (read: header) information is parsed.

Usage can be inferred from the [test project](WoWFormatParser.Tests/Tests.cs).
